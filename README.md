## 🌐 Understanding the Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption method named after Julius Caesar. It shifts letters in the alphabet by a fixed number. For instance, with a shift of 3:

- A becomes D
- B becomes E
- C becomes F

This method is easy to use and provides basic security for your messages. However, it is not suitable for protecting sensitive data, as it can be easily broken.

## 📋 Features
This application includes:

- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Quick encryption and decryption of messages.
- Adjustable shift values for unique results.
- Support for uppercase and lowercase letters.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If you run into issues while using the application, here are some common problems and solutions:

- **Problem**: The application won’t open.  
  **Solution**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download it from the official website.

- **Problem**: I don’t see any output after running a command.  
  **Solution**: Ensure you’ve entered both the message and the shift value correctly.

- **Problem**: The file won’t download.  
  **Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again.
